LaTeXila 2.2
============

- Structure (list of chapters, sections, etc.):
	- run the parsing in an IdleSource (test with big documents)
	- different style (e.g. italic) for commented items
	- improve insert_item_at_position() (shift items if needed)
	- update on the fly the structure when the document is modified
	- right click: cut, copy, paste below, select, delete, comment, shift left/right

- Build Tools:
	- preferences dialog: double click on a build tool -> open properties
	- build tools: copy button to make a copy of a build tool, so we can modify the copy and keep the original
	- build tools properties: resize columns of commands
	- right click menu in bottom panel: copy the line to the clipboard


LaTeXila â‰¥ 2.4
==============

- Check spelling

- Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

- Migrate to GTK+ 3.0

(-) Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
	  A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
