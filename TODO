- Rubber doesn't support filenames with spaces
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/639983

- Consider using Latexmk instead of Rubber:
	- See http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/
	- Filenames with spaces are supported.
	- Latexmk is highly configurable, it seems a better solution.
	- Latexmk is still developed, whereas rubber doesn't seem still in life.
	- Unfortunately the output of the latex or pdflatex commands are not filtered.
	  We can filter the messages internally, as in latexila 0.2 or Kile.
	  Or we can improve latexmk (written in Perl) so it is useful for other projects.
	- An example of command (PDF output):
	  $ latexmk -pdf -e '$pdflatex=q/pdflatex %O -interaction=nonstopmode %S/' file.tex
	  It's not really beautiful, but we must use -interaction=nonstopmode.
	  Another means is to use an RC file (option -r instead of -e).
	- In the output of latexmk we can see which commands are executed, and how many times.
	  It would be useful to show this information too.

LaTeXila 2.2 or later
=====================
See also the Roadmap:
	http://latexila.sourceforge.net/#roadmap

- Build Tools:
	- latexmk post processor:
		- based on latex post processor but show more information (which commands, how many times, etc)
		- add some latexmk build tools that will replace rubber (+ latex -> ps -> pdf)
	- by default show only latexmk, hide the rest
	- preferences dialog: double click on a build tool -> open properties
	- bottom panel:
		- show/hide errors/warnings/badboxes buttons
		- right click menu: copy the line to the clipboard

- List of chapters, sections, etc to easily navigate in a document

- Check spelling

- Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

- Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
	  A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
