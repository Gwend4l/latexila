TODO

For 2.0 (try to do as much as possible)
=======

- Auto-completion:
	- there are critical messages, try to avoid them
	- sometimes a segfault occurs, when typing entirely a command following with "{"
	  See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=618004
	(-) show details by default
	(-) complete placeholders (e.g. \ref, \cite, ...)

- Manage projects:
	- the user gives only the project root directory
	- the *.tex main file is determined (see Kile sources)
	- list of projects
	- delete a project from LaTeXila (the project files are not deleted)
	(-) completion of placeholders: take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project

- Forward and backward search with SyncTeX

- Build documents with rubber:
	- rubber doesn't support filenames with spaces: fix that
	  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/639983
	(-) show errors/warnings/badboxes (improve rubber: add an option that tells which type of message it is)

(-) Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).

(-) Choose the character encoding and the line ending type when saving a document

Legend:
(-) less important
