TODO

For 2.0 (try to do as much as possible)
=======

- Auto-completion:
	- parameters completion
	- complete placeholders (e.g. \ref, \cite, ...)
	- close environment (\begin{env} => \end{env})

- Search and replace:
	- optimize incremental search

- Forward and backward search with SyncTeX

- Icons in LaTeX and Math menus
	- is there a script to generate LaTeX icons automatically?

(-) Build documents with rubber:
	- show errors/warnings/badboxes (improve rubber: add an option that tells which type of message it is)

(-) Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).

(-) choose the character encoding and the line ending type when saving a document

Legend:
(-) less important
