For 1.99
========

- File browser

For 2.0 (try to do as much as possible)
=======

- most used symbols

- Build documents with rubber:
	- modify/add/delete build tools with a GUI
	(-) show errors/warnings/badboxes (improve rubber: add an option that tells which type of message it is)

- LaTeX menu:
	- Texmaker has a nice menu => rearrange and add some items

- Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).

- Search and replace:
	- search selected text (if no \n)
	- performance: "delete" min_nb_chars_for_incremental_search

- Set main file:
	- add a comment like this "% mainfile: mainfile.tex" in the first or last three lines of an included file
	- execute a build tool on the main file

(-) choose the character encoding and the line ending type when saving a document


Legend:
(-) less important
