TODO

LaTeXila 2.0
============

- Auto-completion:
	- there are critical messages, try to avoid them
	- sometimes a segfault occurs, when typing entirely a command following with "{"
	  See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=618004
	  does it still occur?

- Manage projects:
	- the user gives only the project root directory
	- the *.tex main file is determined (see Kile sources)
	- list of projects
	- delete a project from LaTeXila (the project files are not deleted)
	- when we compile a document, save all the files opened belonging to the current project

- Rubber doesn't support filenames with spaces: fix that
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/639983

- Translation


LaTeXila 2.2 or later
=====================
See also the Roadmap:
	http://latexila.sourceforge.net/#roadmap

- Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, etc files of the project)

- Forward and backward search with SyncTeX

- Document compilation:
	- show a different icon for errors/warnings/badboxes
	  improve rubber: add an option that tells which type of message it is

- Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
