LaTeXila 2.2
============

- Structure (list of chapters, sections, etc. to easily navigate in a document):
	- Create a custom GtkTreeModel because using a separate tree (with GNodes) becomes
	  too complicated/hackish for the update on the fly.
	  If a custom GtkTreeModel is too complicated for our purpose, find a better way than
	  repopulating all the TreeModel from the GNodes when items are shifted.

	- Update on the fly the structure when the document is modified. An item can be inserted,
	  deleted or modified. The simplest way I think is to re-run the parsing only on the modified
	  lines (with a lower and upper bounds) every 2 seconds for example. This way, we simply
	  delete all items between the two bounds, and the parsing will re-add them correcly.

	- Different style (e.g. italic) for commented items.

	- Right click: cut, copy, paste below, select, delete, comment, shift left/right.
	  Shift left/right is new comparated to Kile. For example we have a big section (with
	  subsections, etc.) and we want to shift it to the left so it becomes a chapter (the
	  subsections becomes sections, etc.).

	- Scroll to the nearest item in the structure when the document's cursor moves.

	- If the document's cursor is _in_ an item, select it in the structure. This is more
	  complicated than it sounds because now we only know the beginning of an item, we don't
	  know where the item ends.

- Build Tools:
	- preferences dialog: double click on a build tool -> open properties
	- build tools: copy button to make a copy of a build tool, so we can modify the copy and keep the original
	- build tools properties: resize columns of commands
	- right click menu in bottom panel: copy the line to the clipboard

- Double-click on a template to open it (in File -> New)
  With the keyboard it should be possible to select the template with the arrows and then open it with "enter".

LaTeXila â‰¥ 2.4
==============

- Check spelling

- Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

- Migrate to GTK+ 3.0
  I wanted to make the migration for the 2.2 release but GtkSourceView 3.0 have removed the
  gtk_source_completion_info_set_sizing() function.
  Also, GTK 3 widgets are a lot bigger, it doesn't fit well with LaTeXila.

(-) Edit toolbar: create a custom MenuToolButton:
    Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
    It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
    A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
