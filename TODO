TODO

LaTeXila 2.2 or later
=====================
See also the Roadmap:
	http://latexila.sourceforge.net/#roadmap

- Structure (list of chapters, sections, etc.):
	- expand/collapse all buttons
	- detect figures and tables (take the caption for the text)
	- show/hide buttons (label, include, table, image, todo/fixme)
	- change the minimum level
	- run the analyze in a thread (test with big documents)
	- open a doc -> analyze it if the structure is displayed
	- keep structure data as long as the file is opened

- Migrate to GTK+ 3.0 and Vala 0.12

(-) Build Tools:
	- preferences dialog: double click on a build tool -> open properties
	- bottom panel:
		- right click menu: copy the line to the clipboard

(-) Check spelling

(-) Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

(-) Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
	  A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
