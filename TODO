- Rubber doesn't support filenames with spaces
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/rubber/+bug/639983

- Consider using Latexmk instead of Rubber:
	- See http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/
	- Filenames with spaces are supported.
	- Latexmk is highly configurable, it seems a better solution.
	- Latexmk is still developed, whereas rubber doesn't seem still in life.
	- Unfortunately the output of the latex or pdflatex commands are not filtered.
	  We can filter the messages internally, as in latexila 0.2 or Kile.
	  Or, better, we can improve latexmk (written in Perl) so it is useful
	  for other projects.
	- An example of command (PDF output):
	  $ latexmk -pdf -e '$pdflatex=q/pdflatex %O -interaction=nonstopmode %S/' file.tex
	  It's not really beautiful, but we must use -interaction=nonstopmode.
	  Another means is to use an RC file (option -r instead of -e).
	- In the output of latexmk we can see which commands are executed, and how many times.
	  It would be useful to show this information too.

LaTeXila 2.2 or later
=====================
See also the Roadmap:
	http://latexila.sourceforge.net/#roadmap

- Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

- Check spelling

- Document compilation:
	- show a different icon for errors/warnings/badboxes
	  If we want to continue using rubber, we must improve it by adding an option
	  that tells which type of message it is.
	  Or we can use latexmk (see above).

- Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
	  A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
