TODO

- Build documents with rubber:
	- clean build files (*.log, *.toc, *.aux, etc)
	- view log (open $shortname.log read-only)
	- modify/add/delete build tools with a GUI
	- show errors/warnings/badboxes (improve rubber: add an option that tells which type of message it is)

- File browser

- choose the character encoding and the line ending type when saving a document
- most used symbols
- quick build configurable buttons

==========================
Not a priority:

- LaTeX menu:
	- Texmaker has a nice menu => rearrange and add some items

- Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).

- Search and replace:
	- search selected text (if no \n)
	- performance: "delete" min_nb_chars_for_incremental_search
