The Roadmap is less detailed, but have a long-term view.
The TODO is more detailed, but focus more on the short-term.

LaTeXila 2.4
============

- Do not migrate to GTK+ 3 [done]
	It's more work than expected. Unless there is a motivated contributor,
	(see the gnome-3 branch) the next 2.x versions of LaTeXila will continue
	to use GTK+ 2.

	For people using GNOME 3, I think it's not an important issue.

	The plan is to do the migration to both a gedit plugin and (obviously)
	to GTK+ 3 at the same time for LaTeXila 3.0 (when gedit supports profiles).

- Possibility to compile an unsaved LaTeX file, to test easily some code without
  the need to save it in a temporary file that we have to delete just after the test,
  and that we don't delete anyway.

  The unsaved file would simply be saved somewhere in /tmp/.

- Completion:
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)


LaTeXila ≥ 2.4
==============

- Completion:
	- show details by default (now we have to click on the button to see
	  the details)

	- Insert an image easily. Instead of a wizzard, the approach is to:
		- have very good completion of:
			- \begin{figure}[here]
			- \includegraphics[here]{and here}
		- automatically complete the label with the filename of the image

	  A big disadvantage of a wizzard is: how to modify easily the image afterwards?
	  Generally, in this case, the user deletes the LaTeX code and re-run the wizzard…

(-) Structure:
	- Select the current section or item when the document cursor moves

	- Update on the fly the structure when the document is modified.
	  An item can be inserted, deleted or modified.
	  The simplest way I think is to re-run the parsing only on the modified
	  lines (with a lower and upper bounds) every 2 seconds for example.
	  This way, we simply delete all items between the two bounds, and the
	  parsing will re-add them correctly.

(-) Edit toolbar: create a custom MenuToolButton:
	Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click
	first on the arrow and then select the item. It would be better if
	the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).

	A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a
	problem for small screens.
