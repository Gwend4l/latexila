TODO

LaTeXila 2.2 or later
=====================
See also the Roadmap:
	http://latexila.sourceforge.net/#roadmap

- Structure (list of chapters, sections, etc.):
	- update the structure on tab changed/file opened/file saved/...
	    attention when opening several files (e.g. on startup)
	- expand/collapse all buttons
	- show/hide buttons (label, include, table, image, todo/fixme)
	- change the minimum level
	- detect figures and tables (take the caption for the text)
	- run the parsing in a thread (test with big documents)
	- different style (e.g. italic) for commented items
	- improve insert_item_at_position() (shift items if needed)
	- update on the fly the structure when the document is modified
	- right click: cut, copy, paste below, select, delete, comment, shift left/right

- Migrate to GTK+ 3.0

(-) Build Tools:
	- preferences dialog: double click on a build tool -> open properties
	- bottom panel:
		- right click menu: copy the line to the clipboard

(-) Check spelling

(-) Auto-completion:
	- show details by default
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

(-) Edit toolbar:
	- create a custom MenuToolButton:
	  Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click first on the arrow and then select the item.
	  It would be better if the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).
	  A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a problem for small screens.
