msgid "The output of Latexmk contains more information: which commands are executed, how many times, their output, and the reasons why Latexmk executes (or doesn't execute) these commands. The output of Rubber, on the other hand, doesn't contain a lot of information. When an error occurs, it can be more difficult to diagnose."

#: C/build_tools.page:97(section/p)
msgid "Also, Rubber filter the output of the <cmd>latex</cmd> or <cmd>pdflatex</cmd> command. As a consequence, when Rubber prints an error, it's more difficult to know which type of error it is. If you use Latexmk, errors are categorized into three types: critical errors, simple warnings and bad-boxes (for example when a word exceed the margin). With Rubber, there is no distinction between critical errors and simple warnings. See <link xref=\"#post-processors\"/> for more information."

msgid "Latexmk is more flexible. Each low-level command can be customized, for example for adding a parameter, or use a completely other tool.
