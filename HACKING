=======================

LaTeXila source code is maintained using the Git version control system
and is available at the following location:

    git://github.com/swilmet/latexila.git

A Web Interface is available at:

You can download the source code from the Git repository by doing:

If you want to contribute to LaTeXila, contact the main developer (see the file AUTHORS).
Here is how you can generate a patch:

But a pull request is better.

There are some rules to follow when coding:
    - indentation: 4 spaces
    - lines: 90 characters maximum (in some cases it can be a little more)
    - same coding style everywhere
